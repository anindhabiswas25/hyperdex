    { q: 'Why sealed-bid instead of open auction?', a: 'Open auctions degenerate into minimal-increment games where makers undercut each other by fractions of a basis point. Sealed bids force each maker to submit their genuine best price, leading to better outcomes for takers.' },
    { q: 'What happens if no makers respond to an auction?', a: 'After 30 seconds with zero bids the auction ends in a "no_quotes" state. The taker is informed and can retry immediately. This is rare when makers are online and have vault inventory.' },
    { q: 'Can a quote be used more than once?', a: 'No. The quote_verifier stores a spent-quote ledger set. Once quote_id is recorded as settled, any resubmission is rejected — even if the signature is valid.' },
    { q: "What if the vault runs out of inventory mid-auction?", a: "The maker's Maker SDK checks vault balance before bidding and will not submit a bid it cannot fill. If balance drops between bid and settlement, the Soroban vault.execute_swap() call will fail and revert the transaction." },
    { q: 'Can the admin steal funds from the vault?', a: 'No. The admin has no function in the vault contract. Admin privileges are limited to: deactivating makers in pool_registry, adjusting fee_bps in quote_verifier, and withdrawing accumulated fees from fee_distributor.' },
    { q: 'How is the exchange rate calculated?', a: 'Entirely by the market maker. HyperDex imposes no on-chain pricing model. Each maker uses their own oracle data, inventory position, and risk parameters. Competition between makers ensures the best rate wins.' },
    { q: 'What are the protocol fees?', a: '10 basis points (0.10%) deducted from amount_out. On a 100 EURC → USDC swap at rate 1.09, the taker receives 108.891 USDC (109 × 0.999).' },
    { q: 'Is HyperDex open source?', a: 'Yes. Smart contracts, Maker SDK, and backend are open source. See the GitHub repository linked in the footer.' },
    { q: 'When is mainnet?', a: 'After a security audit of the Soroban contracts and a successful testnet period with multiple independent market makers. Follow the community channels for updates.' },
