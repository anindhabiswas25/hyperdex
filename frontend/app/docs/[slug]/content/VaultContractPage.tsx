      <P>The <Mono>maker_pool</Mono> is the custody layer. Each maker has their <strong>own</strong> pool contract — deployed on demand by <Mono>maker_pool_factory</Mono> at registration — that holds only that maker&apos;s inventory and moves tokens during their swaps. It has no pricing logic; it simply executes what <Mono>quote_verifier</Mono> tells it to.</P>

      <H2 id="why-per-maker">Why one pool per maker</H2>
      <P>Isolating inventory per maker means one maker&apos;s balance can never be spent settling another maker&apos;s quote. The factory deploys each pool with a deterministic salt (<Mono>sha256(maker.to_xdr())</Mono>) so the same address is computed in both simulation and execution.</P>

      <H2 id="why-prefund">Why makers pre-fund their pool</H2>
      <P>Atomic settlement requires the pool to already hold the output tokens at the moment of execution. There is no credit, no flash loan, no JIT — the pool is a real pre-funded balance sheet. This design means every accepted quote is <strong>guaranteed settleable</strong>.</P>

      <H2 id="access-control">Access control</H2>
      <P><Mono>execute_swap</Mono> is the most sensitive function — it moves real tokens. It requires <Mono>require_auth()</Mono> from the registered <Mono>quote_verifier</Mono> address. No other contract or user can call it directly.</P>
